### Use Case
1. Operation Analytics is the analysis done for the complete end to end operations of a company. With the help of this, the company then finds the areas on which it must improve upon. Being one of the most important parts of a company, this kind of analysis is further used to predict the overall growth or decline of a companyâ€™s fortune. It means better automation, better understanding between cross-functional teams, and more effective workflows.
2. Investigating metric spike is also an important part of operation analytics as being a Data Analyst you must be able to understand or make other teams understand questions like- Why is there a dip in daily engagement? Why have sales taken a dip? Etc. Questions like these must be answered daily and for that its very important to investigate metric spike.
